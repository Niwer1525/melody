We're students who love music when learning or working and we know too well the struggle of finding a good music player that's simple, fast, and free. That's why we decided to create Melody. We wanted to make a music player that we would enjoy using ourselves, and we hope that you'll enjoy using it too. We're always looking for ways to improve Melody, so if you have any feedback or suggestions, please let us know. We'd love to hear from you!",
